# fungal-DBiT: Spatial Mycobiome Sequencing

![fungal-DBiT overview](images/Fungal-DBiT.png)

**fungal-DBiT** is a microfluidic-based spatial transcriptomics platform that enables simultaneous, high-resolution profiling of **host and fungal RNAs** within the same tissue section.

Unlike conventional spatial transcriptomics methods that focus exclusively on host polyadenylated transcripts, fungal-DBiT is optimized to capture **fungal transcripts**. The platform integrates:
- Optimized microfluidic spatial barcoding
- Tissue processing protocols compatible with fungal cell walls
- Sensitive detection of low-abundance fungal signals in host tissues

This technology enables spatially resolved analysis of **host–fungal interactions** in complex tissue environments.
